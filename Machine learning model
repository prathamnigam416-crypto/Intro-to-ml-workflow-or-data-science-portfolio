Answer
This code successfully implements a Random Forest Classification model on the Iris dataset. Since your script ends with a printed confusion matrix, it's helpful to understand exactly what those numbers represent and how to interpret the model's performance.
​Breakdown of Your Code
​Loading Data: You are using the Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples of flowers with 4 features (sepal length/width, petal length/width) and 3 target classes (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica).
​Splitting: By using test_size=0.2, you've reserved 30 samples to test how the model performs on data it hasn't seen before.
​Model Training: RandomForestClassifier is an ensemble method that creates multiple decision trees and merges them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction.
​Evaluation:
​Accuracy: A value of 1.00 (100%) or close to it is common for this specific dataset because it is very clean.
​Confusion Matrix: This 3 \times 3 grid shows you exactly which classes were predicted correctly versus which were misclassified.
